### Explore a PCA-based facial recognition algorithm that is known as EigenFaces. 
We used the [yale face](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/YaleB/YaleB_32x32.mat) dataset. The dataset has 2414 images of faces, from 38 different subjects. Each person appears many times in the database under different lighting conditions, etc. The goal of face recognition is to match a new image of a face to an image in an existing database.
